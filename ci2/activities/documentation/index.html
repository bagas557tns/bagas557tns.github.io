		"This website was inspired by an exceprt from Junichiro Tanizaki's In Praise of Shadows. I was inspired by his vivid imagery of traditional Japanese architecture, as well as the arbitrary relationship between shadow and light. Requested to not use imagery, this project pushed my boundaries and made me step outside of my comfort zone."
