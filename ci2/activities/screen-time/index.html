    <p>
      Veronica's internet habits are not too different from those of a typical college student's. When she wakes up, she spends some time on TikTok or Instagram before getting out of bed. She's usually online on her phone, particularly when she is eating meals. Veronica mainly uses the internet to text people and for communication in general. She also uses the Photos app, YouTube and Google Drive a lot for school and work.
