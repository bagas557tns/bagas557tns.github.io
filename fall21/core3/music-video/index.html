		Deee-Lite’s 1990 hit single Groove Is in the Heart had a vibrant and maximalist music video and highlights the resurgence of 70’s era aesthetics in the 90's. The music starts alongside moving psychedelic backgrounds with the figures dancing on top, creating a slightly chaotic experience. The video is filled with visual references to the 1970’s, such as the Soul Train intro, the expressive flora; typefaces, the disco fashion and the symmetrical collages that are reminiscent of album covers for the Zombies or Jimi Hendrix. 

The video was released at the beginning of a new decade, with many reevaluating and pushing back against the Reaganite 80’s over-produced and hyper-consumerist culture. Instead of tightly choreographed scenes like a Michael Jackson music video, Groove is in the Heart feels more loose, handmade and brings back the disco aesthetic that was scrapped in the prior decade. This re-emergence was seen in other contexts too, with the release of movies like Boogie Nights chronicle on the Golden Age of Porn or the Godfather Part 3 reviving a classic 70's film. 

Deee-Lite's music video fused this nostalgic resurgence with trends of the 90s, using new computerized effects to create old psychedelic compositions. It features 70's funk icon Bootsy Collins and Q-Tip from the iconic 90's rap group A Tribe Called Quest in a single video. 

Analyzing this video reminded me of how nostalgia, push-back against current trends and cyclical revivals inform present day design. Much like Deee-Lite celebrating the 70's, there are many present-day examples of design celebrating the democratic web aesthetics of the 90's and pushing against the flat post-iOS looks.
