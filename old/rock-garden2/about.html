	<p>When translated from Marathi, Kadha means a decoction created from medicinal herbs and spices. Alternative medicine systems, known as Ayurveda, have been maintained for centuries within the Indian subcontinent.  These remedies have gone through various modes of record-keeping, from being initially transcribed in Sanskrit on palm manuscripts, to oral retellings passed through generations. <br> <br>Kadha serves to offer a new mode of record keeping, in a digital space. This site serves as a repository for various recipes and ingredients that can offer healing support. <br> <br>As Kadha offers a contemporary take on ancient practices, we must also view these systems through a modern scientific lens. While these remedies can offer many benefits for some, they should not be a substitute for professional medical help. This project intends to archive such ephemeral yet significant elements of South Asian culture.</p>
